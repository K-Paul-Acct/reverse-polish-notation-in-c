# Reverse Polish Notation and Graphing in the Terminal

A program for parsing a mathematical expression and coneverting it to an Reverse Polish Notation. After converting the expression, the program outputs a graph of the entered function to the terminal.
To build a project, in the ```src/``` directory, enter the standard ```make``` rule. The ```bin``` executable file will be in ```src/``` folder.
To change the range of the x- and y-axes values and the number of characters the graph takes up in the terminal, change the corresponding definitions in the ```src/config.h``` file and rebuild the project with ```make```.
